All the Products listed for rent must be in the appropriate category and the Owner is solely responsible for choosing the category in which they will place the Rental Listing. There are products and services which are specifically banned or prohibited to list on the website  through “<b>ByeBuying  Listing Policy</b>” and the list is indicative and not the exhhustive.</p>
      <p>All fees must be disclosed in the Rental Listing. The Rental Agreement is not our responsibility, it is a document at the disposal of our member.</p>
      <p>Extra payments related to the rental of an Product, such as delivery, maintenance or other assistance as linked to a particular rental, must be mutually decided by Member and Renter.</p>
      <p> Specific rental conditions which are not covered in the rental agreement or contract , the security deposit conditions or the available days for rental information , must be mentioned somewhere in the product description or the contract executed between the parties separately.</p>
      <p>The Owner always offers for rent goods that the Renter can physically pick up in a given location, either at the Owner’s address or at another one of his rental locations.</p>
      <p><b>Owner Must Have Rights To The Product Offered For Rent</b></p>
      <p>The Owner must have either own the Product, or be lawfully allowed to rent the Product which he or she lists for rent.</p>
      <p>The Owner, either an individual or a professional, is not allowed in any case to publish any contact information within its Rental Listing. The physical address of the rental location, the Owner’s address, their fax or telephone , an email address or a website address are all considered as contact information.</p>
      <p><b>Owner Cannot Change Price Of Transaction Once Accepted</b></p>
      <p>The Owner cannot in any case change the price of a transaction, which he or she has already accepted. When accepting a Reservation Request, the Owner is committed to charge the price published in the Reservation Request.</p>
      <p><b>No Exchange Of Contact Information</b></p>
      <p>From the moment of the online publication of a Rental Listing for an Product, until the moment the Owner accepts the Reservation Request, the Owner and the potential Renter cannot exchange (whether or not through the Site) their identity, their contact information, the address of the Owner, Renter or Rental Location, their fax or telephone numbers, email address or a web address.</p>

      <p class="lead" style="font-weight: bold">Conclusion of a Rental Agreement/Binding Agreement</p>
      <p>The rental of a product/Service between an Owner and a Renter put  both the parties in contractual obligation and thus Rental agreement shall be binding on both parties. The Owner is free to choose with whom, if anyone, he or she would like to enter into a Rental Agreement. However, once the Owner has accepted the Reservation Request, the Owner and Renter agree that the Rental Agreement is binding.</p>
      <p class="lead" style="font-weight: bold">Rental Agreement Template – Standard Rental Agreement</p>
      <p>For the convenience of the Owner and Renter, ByeBuying makes available to the Owners and Renters, an optional Rental Agreement Template (“Template”). This Template, depending on the type of rental, includes information about the transaction such as the security deposit terms, the length of the rental, the price of the rental as well as all other information often included in rental agreements.</p>
      <p>This template is provided by ByeBuying as an option only, to be modified and added to by the Parties as needed. You agree that ByeBuying is not responsible for any claims related to use of the Template.
